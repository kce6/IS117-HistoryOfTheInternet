 The origins of inter-networked computers has its origin in post-World War II United States.  Originally beginning as a government project,
        the first computers directly connected over a network saw speeds of only 50 kilobytes per second (kbps).  Little did they know, that
        in the years to come, we would come to see speeds 10 times as fast as that as the standard.
